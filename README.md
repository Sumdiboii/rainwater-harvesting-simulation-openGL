## 🚀 Project Overview

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project requires an **OpenGL-supported C++ environment**, such as **Code::Blocks with GLUT** or a compatible compiler setup.

This simulation presents a simple **rainwater harvesting system** using **OpenGL in C++**, where falling raindrops are animated to collect into a gutter system and finally stored in a tank. It offers a visual representation of how basic rainwater harvesting works in real life.

🧩 The project is a **modified version of an existing project** found online — we refined the visuals, animation flow, and structural layout to better suit academic or demonstration purposes. The original source could not be verified, hence credit could not be given.
